## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Access the Orders Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/admin/orders`

**Note**: You'll need to be logged in as an admin user. Use the admin setup endpoint if needed:
```bash
POST /api/setup-admin
{
  "email": "admin@omaima.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

### 2. Test Status Filtering
- Click on different status tabs (All, Pending, Confirmed, etc.)
- Verify that orders are filtered correctly
- Check that order counts are displayed accurately

### 3. Test Pagination

- Use Previous/Next buttons
- Verify the "Showing X to Y of Z orders" display

### 4. Test Order Details
- Click "View" button on any order
- Verify navigation to order details page
- Test the "Back to Orders" button

### 5. Test Invoice Download
- Click "Invoice" button on any order
- Verify that a text file is downloaded with order details
- Check that the filename includes the order number

### 6. Test Empty States
- Filter by a status with no orders (if any)
- Verify appropriate empty state message
